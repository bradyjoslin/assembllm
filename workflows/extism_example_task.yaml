name: Sample Calling Wasm with Extism Workflow
description: |
  OpenAI is prompted to provide a joke.  Using a post_script we use the Extism function to run webassembly 
  that counts the number of vowels in the provided response.  The number of vowels is added as a footer to 
  the response output.

  Example usage:
   assembllm -w extism_task.yaml

tasks:
  - name: topic
    plugin: openai
    prompt: "tell me a joke"
    post_script: |
      let wasm = "https://github.com/extism/plugins/releases/latest/download/count_vowels.wasm";
      let vowelCount = Extism(wasm, "count_vowels", input);
      let vowels = (vowelCount | fromJSON()).count | string();
      input + "\n\n vowels: " + vowels
