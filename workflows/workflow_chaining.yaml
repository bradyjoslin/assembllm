name: workflow chaining example
description: |
  This example demonstrates chaining workflow files using the `Workflow` function available in 
  pre-scripts and post-scripts. This goes beyond the single file task chaining capabilities, 
  but allows you to modularize your workflows into separate files for better organization and 
  reusability.

  In this example, we perform market research using Perplexity, then use the results to call a
  separate workflow that generates a email adherent to specific guidelines as the final output.

      Perform research on the latest products announced by Apple, specifically whether they plan
      to release anything related to password management.  If so, that may put significant pressure
      on companies like 1Password and LastPass.  Write a summary of your findings, including any
      potential impact on the password management industry.  If there is news on this front, suggest
      a meeting next Friday to discuss the implications.
