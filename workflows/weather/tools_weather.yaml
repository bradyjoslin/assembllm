  Uses tools / function calling capability that takes unstructured prompt text and returns structured data, 
  which we use to call an api to get the weather forecast for a given location. We then feed the API response 
  into a new task, providing the original prompt and API response for context, getting a response contextualized 
  with weather data.

  Also compatible with the Anthropic plugin.
