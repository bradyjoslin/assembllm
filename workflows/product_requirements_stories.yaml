name: Product Requirements Workflow
description: |
  This workflow takes a topic and generates a PRD with a Product Manager persona, then generates user stories
  and acceptance criteria with an Agile Story persona.  The PRD is generated first, written to a file, which is 
  passed to the Agile Story persona as the prompt.
