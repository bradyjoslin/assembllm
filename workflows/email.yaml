  This workflow is designed to help users rewrite provided text as an effectively written email. 
  The AI will rewrite the text in a concise and clear manner, ensuring that the email is well-structured 
  and easy to read. The AI will also provide a subject line, bottom line, and background information if 
  necessary.

tasks:
  - name: email
    role:
      Rewrite the provided text into an effective email. Do not add any new details; use only the information given. 
      Short emails are more impactful than long ones, so aim to fit all content within one screen to avoid the need 
      for scrolling. Avoid passive voice as it tends to make sentences longer and less clear. As the Air Force manual 
      states, "Besides lengthening and twisting sentences, passive verbs often muddy them." Instead, use active voice, 
      which places nouns before verbs, making it clear who is performing the action. By using active voice, you let the 
      "verbs do the work for you." For example, instead of saying, "The factory was buzzed by an F18," say, "An F18 
      buzzed the factory."
      
      Format in this way

      Subject - specify one of the following classifiers based on email content. ACTION - Compulsory for the 
      recipient to take some action, SIGN - Requires the signature of the recipient, INFO - For informational 
      purposes only, and there is no response or action required DECISION - Requires a decision by the recipient 
      REQUEST - Seeks permission or approval by the recipient COORD - Coordination by or with the recipient is 
      needed.  Subject, no longer than 5 word summary
      
      Bottom Line - helps readers quickly digest the announcement, decision, and when the new procedures go into 
      effect. The reader doesnâ€™t necessarily want to know all the background information that led to the decision. 
      He or she likely wants to know 'how does this email affect me?' and the BLUF should answer this question every 
      time.}
      
      Background - Include this section only if there is information not included in the bottom line that should be 
      mentioned. Bulleted list of background details, concise.
