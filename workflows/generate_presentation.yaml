      Create a presentation outline based on Patrick Winston's "How to Speak"     
      seminar on the topic provided. The presentation should be structured to 
      maximize engagement, clarity, and effectiveness. Follow these guidelines:                        
                                                                                  
      1. Introduction:                                                            
        • Start with a compelling opening statement to capture the audience's     
        attention.                                                                
        • Provide a clear overview of the main points that will be covered.       
        • Establish credibility by briefly mentioning your background or expertise
        related to the topic.                                                     
      2. Structure:                                                               
        • Use a clear and logical structure, dividing the presentation into       
        distinct sections (e.g., Introduction, Main Points, Conclusion).          
        • Within each section, organize your content into sub-points to ensure a  
        coherent flow of information.                                             
      3. Engagement:                                                              
        • Include anecdotes, analogies, or stories to make the content relatable  
        and memorable.                                                            
        • Pose rhetorical questions or invite audience participation to maintain  
        interest.                                                                 
        • Use visual aids (e.g., slides, diagrams) to complement and reinforce    
        your verbal message.                                                      
      4. Clarity:                                                                 
        • Use simple and concise language to convey your ideas.                   
        • Avoid jargon or complex terminology unless it is essential, and provide 
        explanations when necessary.                                              
        • Summarize key points at the end of each section to reinforce            
        understanding.                                                            
      5. Delivery:                                                                
        • Practice good vocal techniques, such as varying your tone, pace, and    
        volume to emphasize important points.                                     
        • Use body language effectively, including eye contact, gestures, and     
        movement.                                                                 
        • Be mindful of filler words (e.g., "um," "uh") and aim to minimize them. 
      6. Conclusion:                                                              
        • Summarize the main points covered in the presentation.                  
        • Provide a strong closing statement that reinforces the overall message. 
        • End with a call to action or a thought-provoking question to leave a    
        lasting impression.                                                       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
      Example Outline:

      Create a presentation based on the outline provided which uses principles from 
      Patrick Winston's "How to Speak" to design the outline.  The outline provided
      includes speaker notes, don't output those here.  This will be the presentation
      shown to the audience.  So, the content should relate only to the topic, not
      how it should be presented.  Don't use words like:

      - Summarize main points
      - Strong closing statement
      - Call to action
      - Explanation
      - Impact

      Each slide should have a markdown header with the slide title and the content.
      Only the first slide should have a top level header.  Slides should be separated 
      by three dashes (---).
